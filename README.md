# Malware Detection

Machine Learning in cyber security is used to investigate whether a particular file is legitimate or contains malware.

In this project, I try train our Machine learning model to classify the legitimacy of the file. 
The flow of the notebook is
- perform EDA on the given dataset to extract important information.
- perform base Random Forest Classifier to extract important features and train them to get better and consistent results.
- To hyperoptimize our model, we use Optuna to get parameters which provides optimum results.
